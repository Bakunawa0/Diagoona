                        <p style="text-align: justify;" class="mb-5">Jiko-Anzen Founder Akio D. Yamamoto was born as a half-Japanese and half-Filipino on October 27, 1982 in Quezon City, Philippines. Akio was the son of a single Japanese mother who moved to the Philippines with her parents, only giving birth to him because she was raped by a Filipino man. Being a foreigner, he was often teased in school and bullied for his narrow Japanese eyes. His classmates made fun of him and often cracked racist “ching-chong” jokes at him, which made it even worse because he’s not even Chinese to begin with. Sometimes, the other kids would even hit him physically and laugh at him trying to fight back and almost always getting beat up after attempting to do so. This was all bearable up until the point when Akio’s mother died of breast cancer in 1998. With no mother to turn to anymore and a severe case of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), the 16-year old didn’t want to keep living. The following year, he attempted to hang himself, but someone from their neighbourhood saw the event and apparently managed to cut the rope with a garden grass cutter, only causing the boy to pass out and wake up in their neighbour’s house. A month later, he came to school with self-inflicted cuts on the wrist. Time passed and he attempted suicide again by jumping off the top of their school building, but only ending up with two broken legs, a cracked pelvis, and a broken wrist. Due to Akio’s problems in school, he was withdrawn from school after the end of the school year, his grandparents transferring with him to Manila.

 </p><p class="mb-5">In his new school, he was no longer bullied, but he noticed that other people were in his place before. Instead of running away from the problems, he decided to step up to the bullies and defend those who were oppressed, as he was once like them and he doesn’t tolerate anything like that. Inspired by this, Akio dreamed of becoming a hero for all those who suffer the same problems. Realizing that suicide is slowly becoming more rampant and more popular among the younger generations, Akio developed the website on 2007 to reach out to all those who need help concerning the issue. Today, Jiko-Anzen is developing very well and has saved thousands of lives across the globe.</p>
